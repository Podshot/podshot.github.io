Thanks to Unity becoming free for personal use, I have been able to get into game development.
After half of a month of level design, feature creation, and constant refactoring, I am happy to release
a Alpha Demo of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Blahcub">Blahcub's</a> and I's game, Two Together!

The current demo contains 3 levels and contains a rough (non-interactive) "Controls and Tutorial" menu.
The game will be released as a downloadable Standalone executable when it is finished. However, currently
the game can be played through your browser of choice (as long as it supports WebGL)
