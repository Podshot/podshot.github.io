*Warning: This is a rant about personal things*


About a week ago, I announced that I was no longer regularly contributing to MCEdit-Unified.
This was a decision I had thought a lot about, I wanted to keep contributing to the project,
but personal events got in the way of my motivation, creativity, and regular mood. Now I have mentioned
a little about these 'personal events' both in my tweets and through Skype conversations. I believe this is
the best way to put it down so I can get it out of my system and maybe relay what is going on in my head to others.
I wanted to write this post about a day after I announced that my contributions to MCEdit-Unified were coming to an
end, but there was one catch, I wanted to tell someone in my life about what was going on with me first. This person
helped me break out of my shell and got me to do things that a few weeks ago, would've been impossible for me. I wanted
them to know how much it meant to me and I wanted to let them know before anyone else.

I have always been a person with a shy personality. I have a very small group of friends and never really
do many outgoing things. However, for a few years now, I have realized that my friend group grows smaller and my
shyness has prevented me from doing things with and without my friends. I have been, for the last few months,
denying to myself that I am a introvert, coupling this with a rough year of school and very mild fits of depression,
I lost enjoyment in most of my favourite activities, programming being the one that took the biggest hit. I have always
looked on the positive side of thing and I accept the fact that everyone will go through a few rough patches during life and
I am hoping that my attitude will help me through this rough time. My decision to deny my introvert-ism took a toll on my mood and as a result, 
I am in a position where I don't what will happen for the next few weeks. I don't know what the next few weeks hold for me, but I want to thank 
everyone, online and in real life, for giving me the best 10 months of my life.
