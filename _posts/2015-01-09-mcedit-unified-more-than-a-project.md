If you have been following my twitter feed or my github activity, you might
have noticed that I have worked on the MCEdit-Unified project. For those who need
a little background, MCEdit was originally created by Codewarrior0, who had
gone inactive for an unknown reason. 

This prompted Khroki to create a fork of the original mcedit to keep development going until either codewarrior0 resumed
development, or abandoned it. I started contributing about a week or two before
the project was renamed to MCEdit-Unified. But this was not just Khroki's or my 
effort. TrazLander joined the project and help get Khroki and I communicating
together. Then Ezekiel joined the project, he created the amazing MCEdit-Unified
website that we know and love today. TrazLander then helped buff up the main development
team by recruting from /r/minecraft and /r/mcedit, this increased the members from
four to thirteen. These developers have made so many contributions that I don't think I can list
each of their numerous contributions to the project and to the team itself.
Each person in the team has various backgrounds, some had never written
a line of python, others were experts in java and HTML, and some (me included) had learned
python and programming in general through MCEdit filters.

However, MCEdit-Unified is not just maintained by the people listed on the contributors page.
MCEdit-Unified and the original MCEdit are more than just a program. They are a part of the
community, it has not only grown with the community, but it helped start a now very large part
of Minecraft's community, map making. Before Command Blocks, before the summon command, before
entitydata, and before WorldEdit, map makers used MCEdit to create custom mobs, edit spawner data,
and test new Minecraft features. MCEdit-Unified or MCEdit are not just the result of a few dedicated
developers, it is a product of an evolving community. Of course, without people like Coderwarrior0,
Khroki, and all the other contributors, we would never have such an amazing tool. However, the real thanks goes to
the community, the people who have put their time, effort, and trust into this program. From reporting
bugs, to writing amazing and complicated filters, to even just spreading the word about a new version.
It is my personal belief, that without the community, MCEdit would have never been as good or used as much
as it is today. I thank everyone who has put their support behind MCEdit-Unified and to those who helped
contribute feature ideas, code, or even just making a video.

I hope that this is not my last major contribution not only to the Minecraft community, but any community or
game. However, if it is, I could've not chosen a greater group of people to develop alongside and I would not
trade this project for any other.

**tl;dr**: MCEdit-Unified and MCEdit are what they are not from the way developers wanted the program to be,
but from community input and involvement.
