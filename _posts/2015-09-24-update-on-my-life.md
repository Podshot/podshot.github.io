Has anyone felt that now matter what they try on something, it always seems to fall apart?
That's kind of the point where I am mentally. For example, I have tried to create over 4 
games in Unity, from historical First Person Shooters, to strategy games, the latest one being
Two Together (which I have the upmost want to complete). However, no matter how much I work on
something, I eventually 'burn-out' and 'put it on the backburner'. For example, I had an idea for
a space station game, but I abandoned it due me taking 3 days just to create one simple door
animation. In addition, I have had some social stress to deal with due to real life events, which has reduced
my motivation and creativity even further. I feel it is harder to talk to anyone, even some of my
most trusted friends. I have never really cared so much for myself, I have almost always put others
before me, because I always seem to be in a good mood knowing that my friends and others are happy,
however, this has put me in a difficult position, as it is harder to motivate myself and to make myself
happy.

This leaves me between a rock and a hard place, because I want to let my best friends know, but I have
already have kind of been pushed to the outside, mostly because of my self-isolation, so I fear how they
will react. I will come back from this, like I have multiple times in the past, but I'm not sure how long
until that happens. I want to thank everyone who has helped me through these times, you have kept me
going and have given me some of the best advice I could've asked for. Every friend I have made through Twitter,
the MCEngineer's chat, and through gaming in general, has been a positive change in my life. I wouldn't
give up the times/conversations I have shared with them for anything else.
