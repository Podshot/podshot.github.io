			<h1>Welcome to PodLauncher</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>PodLauncher is an Open Source Minecraft Launcher written in Java. PodLauncher is designed to be reliable, light-weight and to be extensible.<br>
			PodLauncher comprised of many open source projects, including <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/">JSON.Simple</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api">Tomsik68's MCLauncher API</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-smart/">JSON.Smart</a>
			<br>
			PodLauncher's goal is to maintain an Open Source Minecraft Launcher project and allow anyone to contribute, from ideas and artwork to code and tutorials. PodLauncher consists of two parts, the Launcher, and the Updater.<br>
			Both of which can be found on there respective Github Repositories: <a href="https://github.com/Podshot/PodLauncher">PodLauncher Repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Podshot/PodLauncher-Updater">Updater Repo</a>.
